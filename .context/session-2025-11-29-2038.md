**User:** I ran out of context in the last session can you tell me how I display remaining context percentage in claude code so that I know when I am approaching full
**Assistant:** To display context usage in Claude Code, use the **`statusLine`** setting.

## Quick Setup

Add to your `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "statusLine": {
    "type": "command",
    "command": "~/.claude/statusline.sh"
  }
}
```

Then create `~/.claude/statusline.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
jq -r '.model.contextWindow as $window |
  .cost.tokensUsed as $used |
  ($window - $used) as $remaining |
  ($remaining / $window * 100) as $percentage |
  "Context: \($percentage | floor)% remaining"' 2>/d...

**User:** ok please do this for mw
**Assistant:** Done! I've set up context percentage display for you:

**Created:** `~/.claude/statusline.sh`
**Updated:** `~/.claude/settings.json`

The status line will show:
- **Normal** - "Context: X% remaining" when above 40%
- **Yellow** - warning when 20-40% remaining
- **Red** - critical when below 20%

**Restart Claude Code** for the changes to take effect. You should then see the context percentage in the status bar at the bottom.
