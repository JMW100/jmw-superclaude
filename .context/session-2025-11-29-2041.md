**User:** I ran out of context in the last session can you tell me how I display remaining context percentage in claude code so that I know when I am approaching full
**Assistant:** To display context usage in Claude Code, use the **`statusLine`** setting.

## Quick Setup

Add to your `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "statusLine": {
    "type": "command",
    "command": "~/.claude/statusline.sh"
  }
}
```

Then create `~/.claude/statusline.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
jq -r '.model.contextWindow as $window |
  .cost.tokensUsed as $used |
  ($window - $used) as $remaining |
  ($remaining / $window * 100) as $percentage |
  "Context: \($percentage | floor)% remaining"' 2>/d...

**User:** ok please do this for mw
**Assistant:** Done! I've set up context percentage display for you:

**Created:** `~/.claude/statusline.sh`
**Updated:** `~/.claude/settings.json`

The status line will show:
- **Normal** - "Context: X% remaining" when above 40%
- **Yellow** - warning when 20-40% remaining
- **Red** - critical when below 20%

**Restart Claude Code** for the changes to take effect. You should then see the context percentage in the status bar at the bottom.

**User:** Caveat: The messages below were generated by the user while running local commands. DO NOT respond to these messages or otherwise consider them in your response unless the user explicitly asks you to.
**Assistant:** No response requested.

**User:** <command-name>/exit</command-name>
            <command-message>exit</command-message>
            <command-args></command-args>
**Assistant:** Let me test the script and check what data is actually available:

**User:** <local-command-stdout>Goodbye!</local-command-stdout>
**Assistant:** The script works. Let me check what data Claude Code actually sends to the statusline:

**User:** hi I restarted but I do not see anything that looks like remaining context weindow
**Assistant:** I've updated the script to capture the raw data. **Restart Claude Code again**, type something, then come back and I'll check what data it actually sends. 

Or run this in a separate terminal to see immediately:
```bash
cat /tmp/claude-statusline-debug.json | jq .
```

**User:** <command-name>/exit</command-name>
            <command-message>exit</command-message>
            <command-args></command-args>

**User:** <local-command-stdout>Bye!</local-command-stdout>
