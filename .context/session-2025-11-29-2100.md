**User:** review the last couple of sessions, not in the .context directory but anywhere that claude code keeps its context. I entered a command which involved the '/research direvn best practices' directory and I cannot remember what it was
**Assistant:** Found it! Here's the command you entered:

```
I did some research into best practices for developing code with LLMs, I specified 
the tech stack indicated in /preferences/web-app-db.md but not the other ones so I 
think that while some of the best practices are general, some are specific to that 
tech stack. I do like some of the more general ones such as TDD and introducing

incorporate these best practices and s...

**User:** this is it but park that for now my status line is giving me ?% context window used please investigate ultrathink
**Assistant:** Found the issue. The usage data is nested inside `.message.usage`, but the script is looking for `.usage` at the top level. Let me verify:

**User:** Caveat: The messages below were generated by the user while running local commands. DO NOT respond to these messages or otherwise consider them in your response unless the user explicitly asks you to.
**Assistant:** Found it. The script looks for `.usage` but the data is at `.message.usage`. Let me fix the statusline.sh:

**User:** <command-name>/exit</command-name>
            <command-message>exit</command-message>
            <command-args></command-args>
**Assistant:** Fixed. The bug was in the jq path:
- **Before**: `.usage` (top-level, doesn't exist)
- **After**: `.message.usage` (correct nested path)

The status line should now show ~19% instead of `?%`. The change takes effect on the next status line update.

**User:** <local-command-stdout>Goodbye!</local-command-stdout>
