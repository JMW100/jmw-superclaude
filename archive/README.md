## Why Keep Archives?

Following [ADR best practices](https://adr.github.io/), we preserve historical documentation to:

1. **Provide context** - Understanding why decisions were made
2. **Track evolution** - Seeing how the plugin developed over time
3. **Avoid repeating research** - Reference previous analysis when similar questions arise

## How to Use

- **Don't modify** archived content (it's historical record)
- **Do reference** archived content when understanding past decisions
- **Do check** the "Superseded By" column to find current documentation
