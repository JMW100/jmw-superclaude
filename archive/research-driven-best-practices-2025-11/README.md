# Research-Driven Best Practices (Archived)

**Status:** ⚠️ SUPERSEDED
**Superseded By:** `/tasks/prd-best-practices-integration.md`
**Date Archived:** 2025-11-30

## What This Was

Research and analysis of best practices for LLM-assisted development, conducted to identify patterns worth incorporating into jmw-superclaude.

## Key Documents

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `ASSESSMENT.md` | Gap analysis comparing research to existing skills - documents which patterns were adopted, rejected, and why |
| `PRD.md` | Draft PRD (superseded by formal PRD in `/tasks/`) |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Example SaaS project CLAUDE.md showing stack-specific configuration |
| `docs/decisions/` | ADR examples (database choice, frontend architecture) |
| `claude/skills/` | Research skill patterns that informed new stack-specific skills |
| `claude/commands/` | Workflow command patterns for reference |

## Outcome

This research was synthesized into the formal PRD at:
**`/tasks/prd-best-practices-integration.md`**

The formal PRD documents:
- Which patterns were adopted and how
- Which patterns were rejected and why
- Implementation phases and task breakdown

## Moved to Active Docs

`building-robust-systems-guide.md` was moved to `/docs/` as it remains relevant for plugin users.
